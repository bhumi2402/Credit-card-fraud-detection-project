# Credit-card-fraud-detection-project
Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a model capable of accurately identifying potentially fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset of historical transaction data labeled as fraudulent or legitimate, the model should be able to detect anomalies in real-time, providing an essential layer of security for customers and financial institutions.

Data
The dataset typically used in such projects contains transaction data with features like:

Transaction amount
Transaction time
User and transaction location
Frequency of transactions
Historical transaction behavior
For privacy, credit card fraud datasets, such as those available from Kaggle, are often anonymized, where sensitive details (like account numbers or personal identifiers) are hidden.

Techniques and Approach
Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: Handle any missing or inconsistent data.
Feature Scaling: Standardize features like transaction amount to ensure uniformity.
Balancing the Dataset: Since fraud cases are often rare, use techniques like under-sampling or Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze and visualize transaction distributions.
Identify patterns that distinguish fraudulent from legitimate transactions.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that might help distinguish fraudulent from normal behavior, such as average transaction amount per day, transaction frequency, etc.
Model Selection:

Machine Learning Models: Use models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Deep Learning Models: For complex pattern recognition, try LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks or Autoencoders.
Evaluation Metrics:

Given the class imbalance, focus on metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) rather than accuracy.
Model Deployment:

Deploy the model on a cloud service or integrate it into a financial application for real-time fraud detection.
Implement mechanisms for monitoring the modelâ€™s performance, retraining periodically to adapt to new fraud patterns.
Results
The goal is to achieve high recall (i.e., identifying as many fraudulent transactions as possible) without compromising too much on precision. In production, the model should assist human fraud analysts, flagging high-risk transactions for further review.

Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy for data processing
Scikit-learn for machine learning
TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning (optional)
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Flask/Django for API deployment
Cloud Services (AWS, GCP, etc.) for real-time deployment (if applicable)
This project showcases expertise in data preprocessing, machine learning, anomaly detection, and real-time deployment, key skills in the data science domain
